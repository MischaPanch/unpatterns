# Unpatterns

Too hacky to be a pattern, not bad enough to be an antipattern - Unpatterns!

The things collected in this repository are ungodly mostrosities that I dreamt up in sleepless nights,
and considered them to be elegant but also a bit dangerous and very unusual.

I don't recommend using them in production code! They will raise eyebrows. Your colleagues might shun you.
Your partner could leave you, your dog might run away, and your plants will dry out!

You have been warned!

1. [Protocol Decorator](protocol_decorator.md) 
One boring and two crazy ways to build a decorator of a class.
2. [Salvaging python's object](object_with_getstate.ipynb)
Highlighting important problems of persisting objects in Python, 
and hacking through the builtins to solve them. Worth a read if you
want to know more (and care) about backwards compatibility for saved objects.
3. Allowing operators to be applied to functions: TBA
