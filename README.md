# Unpatterns

Too hacky to be a pattern, not bad enough to be an antipattern - Unpatterns!

The things collected in this repository are ungodly mostrosities that I dreamt up in sleepless nights,
and considered them to be elegant but also a bit dangerous and very unusual.

I don't recommend using them in production code! They will raise eyebrows. Your colleagues might shun you.
Your partner could leave you, your dog might run away, and your plants will dry out!

You have been warned!
